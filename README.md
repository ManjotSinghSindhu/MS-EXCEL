HR Dashboard using MS Excel
HR dashboards are useful for analyzing performance and identifying areas for improvement in an organization. Theyâ€™re not only important to HR managers, but for C-level executives as well. Decision makers ensure that company strategy is aligned from executive to managerial to individual goals. Executives and HR leaders must work together to identify the data they need in order to take action. Then you can collect and monitor that data to keep workforce performance aligned with organizational objectives.
A good HR dashboard will provide a concise and intuitive display of clear key performance indicators.
